# IBACarouselView Sample
This sample shows how to use the IBACarouselView control.

Unfortunately we can't ship example 360 carousel images with this sample as we were using Apple's material and that is probably covered by copyright.  But in this folder there is a script (download_images.sh) that downloads the images we used in the sample into the Resources folder.
